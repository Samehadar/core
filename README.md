[Smart Backpacker](http://smartbackpackerapp.com) is an App where you can find Visa Requirements information for any country in the world regardless of your nationality, currency exchange, health information and airline's baggage policy among others.

- Download it for `Android` [here](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=io.github.gvolpe.sb).
- Download it for `iOS` [here](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/smartbackpackerapp/id1322542121?ls=1&mt=8)

### Modules

#### Api

It's the main back-end application exposing the Http Rest API (See [documentation](http://docs.smartbackpackerapp.com/)). It also contains a token generator.

- Dependencies
    - [Fixer.io](http://fixer.io/) running on [localhost:8081](http://localhost:8081) using `docker-compose`. See the source code [here](https://github.com/hakanensari/fixer). Or you can also use the public API, just change the URL in the configuration.

#### Airlines

It contains the job to insert new airline's data using plain files as the source (`fs2.io` is used here).

#### Common

It contains some utils for `cats.effect.IO`, `fs2.Stream`, logging, testing, etc.

#### Scraper

It has all the html page parsers and scrapers and all the jobs to insert parsed data into the DB.

```
sbt project scraper
```

- Retrieve Visa Requirements from Wikipedia and persist it to the DB:
```
run visaRequirements
```

- Retrieve Visa Restrictions Index (Passport Ranking) from Wikipedia and persist it to the DB:
```
run visaRanking
```

- Retrieve Health information from CDC and persist it to the DB:
```
run healthInfo
```

- Insert initial data (Countries and Visa Categories) into the DB:
```

run updateCountries
run loadVisaCategories
```


### Database

Smart Backpacker uses [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/) as the main data storage.
